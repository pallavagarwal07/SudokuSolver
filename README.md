# Sudoku Solver

Recently, I have been having fun using SAT solvers for a variety of tasks. This time I
thought I would model sudoku problems as a boolean satisfiability problem. I'm surprised
it works so good. I tried it on the problem that comes up on googling `hardest sudoku
problem ever`. It solved it within miniseconds and without a hiccup.
