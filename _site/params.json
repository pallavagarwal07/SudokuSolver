I'm surprised\r\nit works so good. I tried it on the problem that comes up on googling `hardest sudoku\r\nproblem ever`. It solved it within miniseconds and without a hiccup.\r\n\r\nCredit: Picosat has been used for solving SAT equations in this program.\r\n<h1> Test to see if pure html works </h1>\r\n\r\n",
